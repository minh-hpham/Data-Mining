Problem 2. Min Hashing

2A. Min Hashing using grams G2 for D1 and D2: 

t = 20: 1.00
t = 60: 1.00
t = 150: 1.00
t = 300: 1.00
t = 600: 0.99
t = 750: 0.99
t = 900: 0.99
t = 1050: 0.98
t = 1200: 0.98
t = 1350: 0.98
===============================================

Problem 3. LSH

3A. Find b and r for f(s) with t=160: 

b = 14.2291

r = 159.9983

3B. Probability of each G2 pair for being estimated to having similarity grate than tao=.7: 

pr[D1.txt D2.txt] = 1.000000000000

pr[D1.txt D3.txt] = 0.065308847153

pr[D1.txt D4.txt] = 0.000007192274

pr[D2.txt D3.txt] = 0.048568311471

pr[D2.txt D4.txt] = 0.000007471307

pr[D3.txt D4.txt] = 0.000009959154
